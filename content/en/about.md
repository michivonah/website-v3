Hi! My name is Michi and I'm interested in smartphones, computers, e-mobility (mainly Tesla) and other exciting technology.

- 19 years old
- Trainee computer scientist (Informatiker Plattformentwicklung)

I like to spend my free time at the computer. I either code little things for myself ([see GitHub](https://github.com/michivonah)), like this website, or host new software on my infrastructure. I also enjoy going for walks and listening to music or podcasts. I'm also a big fan of Europa-Park and visit it regularly. To optimise my day there, I even built a bot that informs me about the current waiting times via push notification on my smartphone ([here are the details on GitHub](https://github.com/michivonah/themepark-alerts)). I also like to fly my drone or take photos with my smartphone. And sometimes I bake a cake.

Apart from that I am an Apple & Tesla fan and my dream is to own a Tesla myself one day. :)
