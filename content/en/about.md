Hi! My name is Michi and I'm interested in IT, themeparks and exciting new technologies.

*   {{< age "16,09,2005" >}} years old
    
*   Completed apprenticeship as Informatiker EFZ Plattformentwicklung with grade 5.7
    

I like to spend my free time on the computer. I either code little things for myself ([see GitHub](https://github.com/michivonah)), such as this website, or host new software on my infrastructure. I share what I learn on my blog so that others can benefit from it too.

I also enjoy going for walks and listening to music or podcasts. I am a big fan of Europa-Park and visit it regularly.
To make the most of my day there, I even built a bot that sends push notifications to my smartphone with the current wait times ([here are the details on GitHub](https://github.com/michivonah/themepark-alerts)).

I also enjoy flying my drone, taking photos with my smartphone, and traveling. And sometimes I bake a cake. :)
