I have always been interested in computers and technology in general. As a child, I always wanted to have my own laptop and made laptops, printers and other things I wanted out of cardboard. I was then able to fulfil my dream of having my own laptop in second grade. Since then, I have continued to be interested in computer science and have always learnt new things.

So it's no surprise that I decided to do an apprenticeship as a computer scientist and can now turn my hobby into a career.
